# Inventory Management System using Java
I have created GUI based Inventory management system using Java. I have used Java Swing for GUI designing.
I have used MYSQL Database to connect system with database. 

Admin can add product details, update and remove products. Customer can search products category wise, place and cancel order, purchase the products, make transaction and get receipt.
